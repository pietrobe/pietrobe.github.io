I am a computational mathematician focusing on numerical analysis and PDEs modelling through large-scale simulations, particularly for applications in neuroscience, solar physics, and electrophysiology. 

Currently, I am a scientific collaborator within the Institute of Solar Research Aldo e Cele Daccò (IRSOL) and a lecturer at **Università della Svizzera Italiana (USI)**.

### Research interests
+ **Cell-by-cell models** to efficiently simulate cellular dynamics at the micron scale in the brain.
+ **Polarized radiative transfer**, performing large 3D simulations from MHD models to better understand Sun magnetism.
+ **High performance computing** and design of scalable multilevel solutions for discretized PDEs.
+ Novel **scientific machine learning** methods with applications to computational physics. 
+ **Numerical linear algebra** and the analysis of spectral properties of matrix sequences, with application to fast solvers. 
+ **Space-time** and **Parallel-in-time** methods.

### Education
+ **Ph.D.**, Computational Science, Università della Svizzera Italiana, 2020
+ **M.A.**, Applied Mathematics and Computational Science, Università della Svizzera Italiana & ETH Zürich, 2015
+ **B.S.**, Physics, University of Pavia, 2013
